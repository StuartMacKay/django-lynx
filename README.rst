A Django-based link aggregator "inspired" by `Hacker News`_ and `Lobste.rs`_.

The motivation for this is to create a Django-based project that can be used
to create a Hacker News styles news service. The same way that Lobste.rs does
for `Ruby on Rails`_. The goal is to get a Django-based project out there so
the secret ingredients in Hacker News can be unveiled and made available to all.

.. _Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/
.. _Lobste.rs: https://lobste.rs/
.. _Ruby on Rails: https://rubyonrails.org/

Requires Django 2.2 or later.
